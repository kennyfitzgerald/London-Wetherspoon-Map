# London Wetherspoon Map

This aim of the project is to utilise web-scraping modules and pandas to collect data of London Wetherspoon pub locations in the capital, then use the geopandas module to plot these on a map of London. 

This was mainly to try to get to grips with web scraping and geopandas. The inspiration came from the annoyance of searching for a Wetherspoon pub (nice and cheap) in London on google maps and having numerous non-wetherspoon pubs popping up! 

An example output map (as of October 2020) can be seen in the .svg file.
